Analyzing the complex network modeling the Western United States power grid. Aiming to understand its structural vulnerabilities, increase resilience against unexpected disruptions, and ensure a more reliable and stable power grid.

## Data Description

The nodes in this network represent power stations, while the edges symbolize the transmission lines connecting these stations. By studying this network, we hope to understand the impact of various failure scenarios and improve our knowledge of critical infrastructure networks.

## Research Questions

The core inquiry of our analysis:
> Which nodes in the network are most critical to its overall stability and efficiency?
